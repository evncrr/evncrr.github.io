models.
### Kaggle Projects
[“Analyzing What Determines Baseball Hall of Fame Induction”](https://github.com/evncrr/module-final)
- Collected and cleaned historical MLB data from Kaggle to analyze Hall of Fame voting trends.
- Built and evaluated an XGBoost classification model to predict induction likelihood based on performance and accolades.
- Applied similarity metrics and clustering (PCA) to group players by career profiles and identify archetypes of Hall of Famers.
- Created heatmaps and feature importance visualizations to highlight the most influential factors such as hits, RBIs, awards,
and All-Star selections.

["Predicting NBA Contracts Using Statistics"](https://github.com/evncrr/module-6)

- Translated analytical results into business insights for NBA general managers, demonstrating how data-driven modeling can support contract valuation and salary cap decisions.

["Identifying MLB Batter Archetypes Through Clustering"](https://github.com/evncrr/module-4)
- Clustered MLB hitters (1871–2015) using KMeans on standardized per–at-bat offensive metrics to identify five distinct batting archetypes (power, contact, speed, balanced, replacement-level).
- Engineered career-level features by aggregating seasonal data, filtering players with 1,000+ at-bats, and normalizing statistics using StandardScaler to ensure fair similarity comparisons.
- Selected optimal cluster count (k = 5) using the elbow method and applied PCA for dimensionality reduction and cluster interpretation.
- Translated clustering results into actionable lineup and roster insights for MLB managers, supporting decisions on batting order construction and player acquisition based on offensive role fit.

["Which MLB Players are Most Similar?"](https://github.com/evncrr/module-3)
- Built a player similarity system for MLB hitters using Euclidean distance on standardized per–at-bat batting metrics to identify offensively similar players.
- Engineered career-level features by aggregating seasonal data, merging player metadata, filtering 1,000+ at-bats, and normalizing statistics with StandardScaler.
- Converted distance metrics into interpretable similarity scores and validated results through real-world player comparisons.
- Delivered actionable insights for MLB managers, supporting lineup construction, free agency evaluation, and player role identification based on statistical similarity.
